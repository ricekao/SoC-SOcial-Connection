# SoC-SOcial-Connection
Problem: Inferring Social Connection from Spatio-temporal Data


# SoC Framework
Stage 1: Feature extraction
  - Meeting Diversity
  - Location popularity
  - Temporal (stability, duration)

Stage 2: Inferring Social Connection with Random Forest (in WEKA)
  - Using the features extracted in Stage 1. to infer social connection


# File Structure
competitor-pgt
  - The implementation of PGT, existing work proposed in ICDM 2014. (implemented in MySQL)

our-method-SoC
  - The implementation of SoC (Stage 1), our proposed method. (implemented in Java and MySQL)
